A transmit-\\nter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,where they bounce off the different tissues and organs toproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver“hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to acomputer, which translates the data into an image on atelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguishsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it isparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of theabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.\\nPurpose\\nThe potential medical applications of ultrasound\\nwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of thesonar technology developed to detect submarines duringWorld War II. The first useful medical images were pro-duced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali-ty had improved to the point that it came into generalmedical use. Improvements in the technology, applica-tion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its lowcost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into thetop drawer of medical imaging techniques.While pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com-\\nmonly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy ,\\nultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominalimaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech-nologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizingradiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better thanplain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of softtissue structures, and can be used in any of severalmodes, depending on the need at hand.\\nAs an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally\\nis warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acuteabdominal pain ; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus-\\npected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan-creatic disease, gallstones , spleen disease, kidney dis-\\nease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominalaortic aneurysm . Specifically:\\n• Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can\\nsignal a serious problem—from organ malfunction orinjury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasoundscanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten-tial causes when presented with general or ambiguoussymptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can bestudied for signs of disease that appear as changes insize, shape and internal structure.\\n• Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as a\\ncar crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injuredabdominal organs is often the most serious threat tosurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding areimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as aninitial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and itcan be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severityof hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds ,f r o m\\na bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreignobject and provide a preliminary survey of the damage.The easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech-nology has brought it into common emergency roomuse, and even into limited ambulance service.\\n• Abdominal mass.

In\\nparticular, potentially malignant solid tumors can bedistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts andabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ orpart of the abdomen can be found.\\n• Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liver\\ndisease are numerous, though jaundice tends to be a\\ngeneral symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate betweenmany of the types and causes of liver malfunction, andis particularly good at identifying obstruction of thebile ducts and cirrhosis , which is characterized by\\nabnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow.\\n• Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation of\\nthe pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as arepancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt properfunctioning.\\n• Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions\\nthan any other digestive malady. These calculi cancause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and alsoobstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymesfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall-stones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.\\n• Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to\\ninjury during abdominal trauma. It may also becomepainfully inflamed when beset with infection orcancer . These conditions also lend themselves well to\\nultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.\\n• Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic\\ninjury and are the organs most likely to form calculi,which can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi-\\nsoning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing distinct\\nchanges in kidney morphology can also lead to com-plete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has provenextremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.\\n• Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak\\nspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blooddirectly from the heart to the entire lower body. Theseaneurysms are relatively common and increase inprevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi-nently life-threatening. However, they can be readilyidentified and monitored with ultrasound before acutecomplications result.\\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treat-\\nment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid duringsurgical procedures—such as guiding needle placementto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells forbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications forultrasound are being developed.\\nThe direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies\\nin their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just likeaudible sound, and vibrate the materials through whichthey pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice-able at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging.Properly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound canbe used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues.\\nHigh-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat\\nsoft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associatedscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro-mote rapid healing through increased circulation. Strong-ly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound canalso be used to physically destroy certain types oftumors, as well as gallstones and other types of calculi.Developing new treatment applications for ultrasound isan active area of medical research.\\nPrecautions\\nProperly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtually\\nwithout risk or side effects. Some patients report feelinga slight tingling and/or warmth while being scanned, butmost feel nothing at all. Ultrasound waves of appropriatefrequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggra-vate any medical condition, though any woman whothinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue withher doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound.\\nThe value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,\\nhowever, depends greatly on the quality of the equipmentused and the skill of the medical personnel operating it.Improperly performed and/or interpreted, ultrasound canbe worse than useless if it indicates that a problem existswhere there is none, or fails to detect a significant condi-tion. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpen-sive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment canperform the procedure whether qualified or not. Patientsshould not hesitate to verify the credentials of techni-cians and doctors performing ultrasounds, as well as thequality of the equipment used and the benefits of the pro-posed procedure.\\nIn cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment tool,\\npatients should educate themselves about the proposedprocedure with the help of their doctors—as is appropri-ate before any surgical procedure. Also, any abdominalultrasound procedure, diagnostic or therapeutic, may behampered by a patient’s body type or other factors, suchas the presence of excessive bowel gas (which is opaqueto ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are oftennot good candidates for abdominal ultrasound.\\nDescription\\nUltrasound includes all sound waves above the fre-\\nquency of human hearing—about 20 thousand hertz, orcycles per second. Medical ultrasound generally uses fre-quencies between one and 10 million hertz (1-10 MHz).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2Abdominal ultrasoundGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 2'),\n",

While notnecessarily harmful, such organs can cause prob-lems if they grow too large or become cancerous. Inany case, their presence points to an underlyingabnormality in the parent organ.\\nBenign —In medical usage, benign is the opposite of\\nmalignant. It describes an abnormal growth that is\\nstable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.\\nBiopsy —The surgical removal and analysis of a tis-\\nsue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, the\\nterm refers to the collection and analysis of tissuefrom a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.\\nCalculus —Any type of hard concretion (stone) in\\nthe body, but usually found in the gallbladder, pan-\\ncreas and kidneys. They are formed by the accumu-lation of excess mineral salts and other organicmaterial such as blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) cancause problems by lodging in and obstructing theproper flow of fluids, such as bile to the intestines orurine to the bladder.\\nCirrhosis —A chronic liver disease characterized by\\nthe invasion of connective tissue and the degenera-\\ntion of proper functioning—jaundice is often anaccompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis includealcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges-tive heart disease.\\nCommon bile duct —The branching passage\\nthrough which bile—a necessary digestive\\nenzyme—travels from the liver and gallbladder intothe small intestine. Digestive enzymes from thepancreas also enter the intestines through the com-mon bile duct.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan) —A special-\\nized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused\\nand relatively low energy radiation to producedetailed two-dimensional images of soft tissuestructures, particularly the brain. CT scans are thechief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higherquality images not disrupted by bone or gas. Theyare, however, more cumbersome, time consumingand expensive to perform, and they use ionizingelectromagnetic radiation.\\nDoppler —The Doppler effect refers to the apparent\\nchange in frequency of sound wave echoes returning\\nto a stationary source from a moving target. If theobject is moving toward the source, the frequencyincreases; if the object is moving away, the frequen-cy decreases. The size of this frequency shift can beused to compute the object’s speed—be it a car onthe road or blood in an artery. The Doppler effectholds true for all types of radiation, not just sound.\\nFrequency —Sound, whether traveling through air\\nor the human body, produces vibrations—mole-\\ncules bouncing into each other—as the shock wavetravels along. The frequency of a sound is the num-ber of vibrations per second. Within the audiblerange, frequency means pitch—the higher the fre-quency, the higher a sound’s pitch.\\nIonizing radiation —Radiation that can damage liv-\\ning tissue by disrupting and destroying individual\\ncells at the molecular level. All types of nuclearradiation—x rays, gamma rays and beta rays—arepotentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibratethe material through which they pass, but do notionize it.\\nJaundice —A condition that results in a yellow tint\\nto the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in\\nthe liver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediatecause, but the underlying cause could be as simpleas obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall-stone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasoundcan distinguish between these conditions.\\nMalignant —The term literally means growing worse\\nand resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym for\\ncancerous and connotes a harmful condition thatgenerally is life-threatening.\\nMorphology —Literally, the study of form.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Medical_book_compressed-15-20.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce more\\ndetailed images, but are also more readily absorbed andso cannot penetrate as deeply into the body. Abdominalultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequenciesbetween 2-5 MHz.\\nAn ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the\\ntransducer and the analyzer. The transducer both producesthe sound waves that penetrate the body and receives thereflected echoes. Transducers are built around piezoelec-tric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric refers to electricity thatis produced when you put pressure on certain crystalssuch as quartz). These ceramic chips react to electric puls-es by producing sound waves ( they are transmittingwaves) and react to sound waves by producing electricpulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric puls-es supplied to the transducer causes it to produce thescanning sound waves. The transducer then receives thereturning echoes, translates them back into electric pulsesand sends them to the analyzer—a computer that orga-nizes the data into an image on a television screen.\\nBecause sound waves travel through all the body’s\\ntissues at nearly the same speed—about 3,400 miles perhour—the microseconds it takes for each echo to bereceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into thebody. The relative strength of each echo, a function of thespecific tissue or organ boundary that produced it, can beplotted as a point of varying brightness. In this way, theechoes are translated into a picture. Tissues surroundedby bone or filled with gas (the stomach, intestines andbowel) cannot be imaged using ultrasound, because thewaves are blocked or become randomly scattered.\\nFour different modes of ultrasound are used in med-\\nical imaging:\\n• A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in\\nwhich a single transducer scans a line through the body\\nwith the echoes plotted on screen as a function ofdepth. This method is used to measure distances withinthe body and the size of internal organs. Therapeuticultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is alsoA-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of thedestructive wave energy.\\n• B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans-\\nducers simultaneously scans a plane through the bodythat can be viewed as a two-dimensional image onscreen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100transducers in sequence form the basis for these mostcommonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000.\\n• M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid sequence\\nof B-mode scans whose images follow each other insequence on screen enables doctors to see and mea-sure range of motion, as the organ boundaries thatproduce reflections move relative to the probe. M-mode ultrasound has been put to particular use instudying heart motion.\\n• Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonography includes the\\ncapability of accurately measuring velocities of movingmaterial, such as blood in arteries and veins. The prin-ciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measurethe speed of a car on the highway. Doppler capability ismost often combined with B-mode scanning to produceimages of blood vessels from which blood flow can bedirectly measured. This technique is used extensively toinvestigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hyper-\\ntension , particularly in the heart, but also in the abdom-\\ninal aorta and the portal vein of the liver. Thesemachines cost about $250,000.\\nThe actual procedure for a patient undergoing an\\nabdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless ofthe type of scan or its purpose. Fasting for at least eight\\nhours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach isempty and as small as possible, and that the intestinesand bowels are relatively inactive. Fasting also allows thegall bladder to be seen, as it contracts after eating andmay not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, afull bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the wayso that the gas they contain does not disrupt the image.The patient’s abdomen is then greased with a special gelthat allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across theskin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.\\nThis procedure is conducted by a doctor with the\\nassistance of a technologist skilled in operating theequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen toobtain different views of the target areas. The patient willlikely be asked to change positions from side to side andto hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desiredviews. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.\\nThe many types and uses of ultrasound technology\\nmakes it difficult to generalize about the time and costsinvolved. Relatively simple imaging—scanning a suspi-cious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aorticaneurysm—will take about half an hour to perform andwill cost a few hundred dollars or more, depending onthe quality of the equipment, the operator and other fac-tors. More involved techniques such as multiple M-modeand Doppler-enhanced scans, or cases where the targetsnot well defined in advance, generally take more timeand are more expensive.\\nRegardless of the type of scan used and the potential\\ndifficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster andless expensive than computed tomography scans (CT),\\nits primary rival in abdominal imaging.

In general though, such damage wouldonly result from improper use of the equipment.\\nAny woman who thinks she might be pregnant\\nshould raise this issue with her doctor before undergoingan abdominal ultrasound, as a fetus in the early stages ofdevelopment could be injured by ultrasound meant toprobe deeply recessed abdominal organs.\\nNormal results\\nAs a diagnostic imaging technique, a normal abdom-\\ninal ultrasound is one that indicates the absence of thesuspected condition that prompted the scan. For example,symptoms such as a persistent cough , labored breathing,\\nand upper abdominal pain suggest the possibility of,among other things, an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Anultrasound scan that indicates the absence of an aneurysmwould rule out this life-threatening condition and point toother, less serious causes.\\nAbnormal results\\nBecause abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally\\nundertaken to confirm a suspected condition, the resultsof a scan often will prove abnormal—that is they willconfirm the diagnosis, be it kidney stones, cirrhosis ofthe liver or an aortic aneurysm.

The\\nstomach and intestines begin development outside thebaby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal wallenclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical openingis too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bow-els or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through theabdominal wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many causes for birth defects that still\\nremain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal walldefects is unknown, and any symptoms the mother mayhave to indicate that the defects are present in the fetusare nondescript.\\nDiagnosis\\nAt birth, the problem is obvious, because the base of\\nthe umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in worsecases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before birth, anultrasound examination may detect the problem. It isalways necessary in children with one birth defect to lookfor others, because birth defects are usually multiple.\\nTreatment\\nAbdominal wall defects are effectively treated with\\nsurgical repair. Unless there are accompanying anom-alies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated.The organs are normal, just misplaced.
